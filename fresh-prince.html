      West Philadelphia</a>, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent
       most of my days:

    <ul>
      <li>Chilling out</li>
      <li>Maxing</li>
      <li>Relaxing, all cool</li>
    </ul>
    I was shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys --
      they were up to <b><u>no good</b></u> -- started making trouble in my neighborhood.
